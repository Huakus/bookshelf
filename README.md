# Library Management System

This is a Library Management System API built with Java and Spring Boot. The system allows for the management of books, users, and loans. It provides the ability for users to borrow and return books, for librarians to add and remove books, and also to view and manage loans.

## Models

The application includes the following models:

- `Book`: Represents a book in the library. Includes properties for title, author, ISBN, and a status indicating whether the book is available or currently on loan.
- `User`: Represents a user of the library. This can be either a reader or a librarian. Includes properties for name, email, password, and role.
- `Loan`: Represents a loan of a book to a user. Includes properties for the book, the user, and the start and end dates of the loan.
